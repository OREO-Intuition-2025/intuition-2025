The 7S model is a management framework developed by McKinsey consultants Robert Waterman and Tom Peters to assess how well an organization's management aligns seven internal elements to support its strategy. The seven elements are: strategy, structure, systems, shared values, style, staff, and skills. The model helps identify what needs to be realigned to improve performance or maintain alignment during changes. It examines how changes in one element impact others. While useful, the model is limited by not considering external factors and not explicitly defining performance. McKinsey also developed a multifactor matrix with GE to evaluate industry attractiveness and business strength.Read less
