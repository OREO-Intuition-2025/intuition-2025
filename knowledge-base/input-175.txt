This study assessed change management and its influence on the productivity of selected public sector organisations by focusing on three public sector organisations in the Bono Regional capital, Sunyani. The study specifically investigated the change management practices, examined the challenges to change management and ascertained the influences of change management on employee productivity in the selected organisations. A mixed method approach was used, and this involved the use of questionnaires and interviews to gather data from fifty-one (51) staff and management of the selected public sector organisations (Non-formal Education Division, Ghana Tourism Authority, and the Ghana Insurance Commission). It was discovered that public sector organisations have undergone minor adjustments to their strategies, which are perceived as effective. Change management practices are nuanced and rely on special teams and external consultants. Employee productivity is positively influenced by organisational change management, but it is hampered by inadequate funding, poor communication, poor team coordination, and low employee involvement. The impact of organisational change on productivity depends on the implementation, employees' perception, and organizational conditions. Addressing challenges and barriers to change is recommended to improve its success rate and impact on employee productivity. Akbar, M. A., Naveed, W., Alsanad, A.
