Platform Architect(AI Architect) | Leading Global AI/ML/MLOps, Engineering Strategy | PhD Scholar - Artificial Intelligence, Executive MBA It's complex. As an architect, I hear this daily, and I aim to simplify it. You can't escape from the fact that if people don't understand, they say it's complex. It doesn't matter if they have just started on their roles or are very much seniors at retirement age. I got compliments from many friends and close circle that I quickly understand complexity, analyse problems, apply rationale and come to conclusions. Is it good or bad? Is it good for me and bad for others? Yes, I can save the most precious resource, my time, but it is terrible if others don't onboard it. It can leave others behind. How do we solve this fundamental problem? You can make complex things easy if people are on board. Otherwise, it doesn't matter how easy it is? or what is best or straightforward for you; it's complex for others. The real challenge will start after you try to make things easy and still get feedback that it's complex. Remember: There's a limit to simplification. Oversimplification can compromise functionality, reliability, or scalability. Then how to proceed further? Consider Facts 1. Everyone is different & thinks and behaves differently. 2. Individuals are focused on their dialogue in big movies. 3. Individuals have different experiences than you. 4. Everyone has different capabilities and capacities. 5. Your problem is only there once they have a role to play in it. 6. Everyone has different causes for onboarding. 7. Not everyone needs to be on board. You can make it simple once you understand and work on the facts after you don't see any scope for making it simple. So make it simple by 1. Making it easy through representation. You can show the same things differently in 100 ways. 2. Walkthrough / Talk / Session. The individual feels more comfortable after listening to them. 3. Challenge understanding. 4. Don't onboard unnecessary people. ✅ If you enjoyed my thoughts, please like, comment and share to see more of them in your LinkedIn feed. ☑ To save your precious time, Follow me on LinkedIn to stay ahead and get valuable insights on 1.

To view or add a comment, sign in VP Product at Uplevel | Developer → PM, focused on dev tools | Ex-Sourcegraph, Palantir | Talk to me about developer productivity The biggest disconnect I see enterprise organizations face is the separation between leadership priorities and the reality developers experience in their daily work. Engineers are told to innovate and work on the top business priorities, but their day-to-day reality tells a different story: 🚀 Leadership’s priorities (on paper): Accomplish these 3 vital business initiatives. 🛑 Reality: Fix bugs, respond to customer incidents, fix broken builds, endure long meetings, and constantly respond to Slack. The problem? Leadership sets ambitious goals, but engineers are faced with an entirely different reality, and rarely have time to work on the most important priorities. If you want innovation, take into account the biggest challenges developers face. Then, unblock them, generate organizational alignment, and accelerate progress. You must measure productivity based on value delivered, which is enabled by deep work and flow. At Uplevel, we help engineering leaders eliminate the roadblocks that hold developers back. It starts with connecting the work you say you want done to the metrics you use to measure developer success. Are you measuring what drives real innovation?

Can you believe it? There is a new model for #Transformation it is called #Continuous. It is all about #Agility, #Aspirations, and Operating Rhythm. Now they tell us :) Companies are expected to spend over $2 trillion globally on #DigitalTransformation in 2024. If you truly understand the meaning of transformation, then you know that it must be continuous, that it is not a destination, and that it can't have a final state. Today, more than ever, companies must include the term "continuous transformation" in their strategy, budget, and vision. That is, of course, if they want to still exist in the future and attempt to predict and serve their customers how customers want to be served and understood. We hope everyone had an amazing week.

Continuing from previous post. Breaking down the current state versus the vision for: metrics, leadership styles, and culture in the product management and innovation space. 1. Metrics Current State: Most organizations emphasize metrics tied to outputs, such as: • Number of features shipped • Deadlines met • Cost efficiency These metrics are straightforward and easy to track but often don’t reflect the true value delivered to users or the long-term impact of the product. Vision: Shift to metrics that measure the actual value delivered to users and the business, such as: • How frequently and deeply users interact with the product? • Are customers staying loyal over time? • Are users advocating for your product? • How much value does each user generate over their lifecycle? • Balancing short-term wins with long-term profitability. 2. Leadership Styles Current State: Directive and Transactional: Many leaders follow traditional, top-down approaches: • Focused on managing deliverables and timelines. • Reactive decision-making, prioritizing short-term fixes over long-term strategy. • Often driven by authority rather than influence, with limited collaboration. Vision: Empathetic and Visionary: Leaders evolve to inspire and guide with a clear purpose: • Encourage autonomy and trust across teams while providing a compelling vision. • Foster a learning mindset, where failure is seen as an opportunity to iterate and grow. • Leading teams with a blend of human connection and clear expectations. • Use influence rather than authority, creating alignment across cross-functional teams. 3. Culture Current State: Siloed and Execution-Focused: • Teams operate in silos, often focused on their own functional goals (e.g., sales, engineering, marketing). • A culture of “delivery over discovery”- the focus is on shipping what’s planned, with less emphasis on whether it’s the right thing to build. • Risk aversion dominates, with limited experimentation and fear of failure. Vision: Collaborative and Purpose-Driven: • Cross-functional collaboration becomes the norm, with all teams working toward shared goals. • Culture prioritizes discovery along with delivery, emphasizing iterative learning and building products that truly solve user problems. • A growth mindset is embraced, encouraging experimentation, learning from failure, and adapting quickly. • Purpose drives decisions, aligning teams around a shared mission that resonates with users, employees, and the business. This shift is indeed challenging because it demands rethinking deeply ingrained habits and practices. But the transformation leads to sustainable growth, stronger user loyalty, and a more engaged workforce.
