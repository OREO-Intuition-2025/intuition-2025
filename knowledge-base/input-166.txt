Is this correct? Change management as a discipline has evolved and matured over the past quarter of a century. Prosci research tells us that for changes to be successful, we must prepare, equip and support individuals moving through changes so that they successfully adopt the changes. Without adoption, changes will not be successful and we will not deliver the desired outcomes. Managing change is often simply comprised of a communications plan, where executive leaders or project managers communicate to the organization that there's change coming (typically on short notice). But change management is much more than communicating what is changing, such as a system implementation or an acquisition. We must support people in the organization through their transitions from the current state to the future state, and understand what is needed to influence each person to embrace and adopt the change. In this way, organizations can significantly increase the chances of project success and their project investments paying off. Organizations adopt the discipline of change management in different ways depending on their business needs. For instance, they have a must-win technology implementation that can benefit from change management, or they decide to invest in change management as an organizational capability to support aggressive business growth. In other words, change management can vary in scope and purpose, and one organization might define and implement it differently than another. So it's especially important that companies leverage a structured yet flexible approach to managing change in their organizations. The application of the structured process and set of tools for leading the people side of change to achieve a desired outcome on our project. A leadership competency for enabling change within our organization and a strategic capability designed to increase our change capability and responsiveness. Whatever change management might look like, the end goal is to help individuals make a change to help the organization be more successful.
