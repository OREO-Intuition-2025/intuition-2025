The Prosci ADKAR Model ADKAR sits at the center of the Prosci Methodology graphic to emphasize that organizational change requires individual change. Organizational change requires individual change The Prosci ADKAR® Model is one of the two foundational models of the Prosci Methodology, in addition to the PCT Model. The word “ADKAR” is an acronym for the five outcomes an individual needs to achieve for a change to be successful: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability and Reinforcement. The model was developed nearly two decades ago by Prosci founder Jeff Hiatt after studying the change patterns of more than 700 organizations. The ADKAR Model is used by thousands of change leaders around the world. This powerful model is based on the understanding that organizational change can only happen when individuals change. Whereas the Prosci 3-Phase Process is a framework for organizational change, the ADKAR Model focuses on individual change—guiding individuals through a particular change and addressing any roadblocks or barrier points along the way. The 5 Elements of the ADKAR Model Organizational changes often fail because employees don’t understand the importance of getting on board the change or how to successfully make the change. They simply understand that a change is happening. And leaders are often not equipped to engage individuals effectively during the change and to manage any potential resistance. The ADKAR Model addresses these challenges by equipping leaders with the right strategies and tools, and individuals with the right information, motivation and ability to successfully move through changes in the organization. By outlining the goals and outcomes of successful change, the ADKAR Model enables leaders and change management teams to focus their activities on what will drive individual change and therefore achieve organizational results.
