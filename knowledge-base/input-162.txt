Abstract: This study proposes the integration of change management with a knowledge management framework to address knowledge retention and successful change management in the context of Industry 5.0. Using the ADKAR model, it is suggested to implement strategies for training and user acceptance testing. The research highlights the importance of applying the human capital life cycle in knowledge and change management, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in adapting to Industry 5.0. The methodology includes a review of the state of the art in intangible asset management, change management models, and the integration of change and knowledge management. In addition, a case study is presented in a food production company that validates the effectiveness of the ADKAR model in implementing digital technologies, improving process efficiency and increasing employee acceptance of new technologies. The results show a significant improvement in process efficiency and a reduction in resistance to change. The originality of the study lies in the combination of the ADKAR model with intangible asset and knowledge management, providing a holistic solution for change management in the Industry 5.0 era. Future implications suggest the need to explore the applicability of the ADKAR model in different industries and cultures, as well as its long-term effects on organisational sustainability and innovation. This comprehensive approach can serve as a guide for other organisations seeking to implement successful digital transformations.
