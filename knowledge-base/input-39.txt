Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with the transition or transformation of an organization's goals, processes and technologies. The purpose of change management is to implement strategies for effecting and controlling change and helping people to adapt to change. Change management activities range from individual projects to large programs, such as digital transformation that introduces many new processes and applications. Change efforts often involve management teams and other stakeholders. Department-level management and employee buy-in is essential. To be effective, a change management strategy must do the following: To understand how change management works, it helps to apply its concepts and tools to specific areas of business. Below are examples of how change management works for project management, software development and IT infrastructure. Change management plays an important role in project management because each change request must be evaluated for its impact on the project. Project managers, or the senior executives in charge of change control, must examine how a change in one area of a project could affect other areas and what impact that change could have on the project as a whole. Project areas that change control experts should pay particular attention to include the following concerns: This article is part of Download this entire guide for FREE now! When an incremental change is approved, the project manager documents the change in one of four standard change control systems to ensure all thoughts and insight have been captured with the change request. Changes that aren't entered through a control system are labeled defects. When a change request is declined, this is also documented and kept in the project archives. In software development project management, change management strategies and tools help developers manage changes to code and its associated documentation as well as help chief information officers and project managers keep projects on track. Agile software development environments encourage changes made to satisfy requirements or adjust the user interface. However, changes aren't addressed in the middle of an iteration. They're scheduled as stories or features for future iterations. Version control software tools assist with documentation and prevent more than one person from making changes to code at the same time. Such tools can track changes and back out changes when necessary. Change management tools are also used to track changes made to an IT department's hardware infrastructure. As with other types of change management, standardized methods and procedures ensure every change made to the infrastructure is assessed, approved, documented, implemented and reviewed in a systematic manner. Changes made to hardware settings are also referred to as configuration management. Technicians use CM tools to review the entire collection of related systems and verify the effects a change in one system has on other systems. Change management can be used to manage many types of organizational change. The three most common types are the following: The best models provide guiding principles and help managers align the scope of proposed changes with available digital and nondigital tools. Popular models include the following: Taking a structured approach to change management helps organizations mitigate disruption, reduce costs, reduce time to implementation, improve leadership skills, drive innovation and improve morale. In addition, there are ways change management can add structure to IT and operations: Companies developing a change management program from the ground up often face challenges. Besides a thorough understanding of company culture, the change management process requires an accurate accounting of the systems, applications and employees that changes are likely to affect. Additional change management challenges include the following: As a conceptual business framework for people, processes and the organization, change management increases the success of critical projects and improves a company's ability to adapt quickly. Business change is constant and inevitable. But when poorly managed, it can cause organizational stress as well as unnecessary and costly rework. By standardizing the consistency and efficiency of assigned work, successful change management assures that the people affected by changes aren't overlooked. As changes to work occur, change management helps employees understand their new roles and build a more process-driven culture. Change management also helps companies remain dynamic in the marketplace and encourages future growth. Three principles of organizational change management build on the three stages of change management introduced by Kurt Lewin in his book Principles of Topological Psychology: Digital transformation has significantly accelerated change management processes in organizations. As businesses increasingly adopt digital technologies, the pace at which changes must be implemented has increased. Digital transformation initiatives often involve the integration of new technologies, the restructuring of processes and the adaptation of organizational cultures. This necessitates a more responsive approach to change management to ensure that transformations are implemented successfully and yield the desired outcomes. Change management and digital transformation are intrinsically linked, with each driving the success of the other. Effective change management is crucial for the successful implementation of digital transformation initiatives. It ensures that the workforce adapts to new technologies and processes, and that the organizational culture evolves to embrace digital advancements. Integrating change management with digital transformation involves aligning the objectives of both approaches to ensure a seamless transition. Change management strategies must be designed with a clear understanding of an organization's digital goals, ensuring that change initiatives support and enhance digital transformation efforts. This integration helps mitigate resistance, enhance stakeholder engagement and ensure the digital transformation's benefits are realized. The integration of digital tools and platforms has enabled organizations to execute change initiatives more swiftly and efficiently. For example, cloud computing facilitates faster deployment of new applications and services, while collaboration tools enable better communication and coordination among team members regardless of their physical location. This digital enablement helps organizations respond faster to market changes, competitive pressure and customer demands. Data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) play a pivotal role in enhancing the effectiveness of change management. These technologies provide insights that can inform the planning, execution, and evaluation of change initiatives. By analyzing data and using AI, organizations can identify patterns, predict outcomes, and make informed decisions about where and how to implement changes. In the planning phase, these tools can identify areas that require change and prioritize change initiatives based on their potential impact. During execution, AI can streamline processes by automating routine tasks and freeing up human resources to focus on more complex aspects of the change management process. AI also provides real-time feedback and analytics, enabling managers to monitor progress and make adjustments as needed. In the evaluation phase, data analytics and AI can assess the success of change initiatives, providing insights into what worked well or didn't. This helps in refining future change management strategies, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation to the evolving digital landscape. The synergy of technology with change management is essential for businesses seeking to thrive in the digital age, where adaptability and responsiveness are key to success. Digital and nondigital change management tools can help change management officers research, analyze, organize and implement changes. In a small company, the tools might consist of spreadsheets, Gantt charts and flowcharts. Larger organizations typically use software suites to maintain digital change logs and provide stakeholders with an integrated, holistic view of change and its effects. The following examples of change management software applications were gathered from sources such as Capterra and G2 as well as various software reviews: Change management practitioners can earn certifications that recognize their ability to manage change projects, manage people and guide an organization through a period of transition or transformation. Several organizations offer certifications for change management. Examples include the following: In general, most people don't like change, even if it's for the better.
