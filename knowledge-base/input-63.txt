Organizations are complex systems that involve different aspects that need to work in a synchronized and integrated way to achieve success. The 7S Model of McKinsey is a management tool that helps organizations to assess and improve their performance by analyzing seven critical factors that are interrelated and interdependent. The 7S Model was developed in the early 1980s by Tom Peters and Robert Waterman, who were consultants at McKinsey & Company, one of the world’s leading consulting firms.
