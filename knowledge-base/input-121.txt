Explore the Levels of Change Management Prosci 7 Mins Updated: March 14, 2025 Published: September 2, 2024 In a business environment where disruption is constant, standing still is not an option. What worked yesterday could quickly become tomorrow’s downfall. Adaptability is now essential for survival. Successful change implementation is difficult, regardless of the approach you use. However, research shows that a structured framework can drive more successful change. Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model was created by Dr. John Kotter in 1995 as a structured, 8-step process for creating urgency, aligning leadership, and embedding change management into a company’s approach. In this article, we’ll break down each step of Kotter’s model, uncover its strengths and challenges, and explore how it stacks up against other change management approaches, helping you chart a successful course for your organization’s future. Change management is a structured and intentional approach designed to prepare, equip, and support individuals through the process of organizational change. It focuses on the people side of change to ensure that people can adopt and use changes effectively, ultimately achieving the desired outcomes and benefits for the organization. In fact, 88% of C-suite leaders believe that the pace of change will accelerate in the next year. With a clear plan, people and organizations become resilient, maintaining a clear sense of purpose and generating enthusiasm at every organizational level, ultimately leading to successful change outcomes. That’s why organizations need structured change management frameworks and models to navigate these transitions effectively. In fact, the use of a structured change management approach is the second strongest predictor of successful change. A change model is a structured approach that provides a roadmap, ensuring that every step of the change management process is accounted for, from initial assessment to planning to full implementation. With a clear framework, leaders can better manage uncertainty, align team efforts and monitor progress, leading to a smoother and more successful transition. A change management model should prioritize leadership, effective communication, and team commitment while also addressing the personal and business impacts of change. Without such a model, change can feel chaotic, increasing the likelihood of failure. One well-known example of a change model is Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model. Developed by Dr. John Kotter, this model seeks to ensure that changes are lasting and successful. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each step: According to Kotter, the change process starts by identifying critical opportunities or risks that demand immediate action. Creating this urgency helps rally support and gain commitment to the proposed changes. In this step, the practitioner should communicate clearly why the status quo is no longer viable. They should use relevant data and examples to illustrate the need for transformation. In this step, the change practitioner builds a strong, influential change management team to lead the change initiative. This coalition should consist of individuals from various levels of the organization, including leaders with authority and employees with influence. The group works together to steer the process, inspire others and proactively address any potential resistance from employees. Next is creating a compelling vision to guide the change efforts. This vision outlines the desired outcome and explains how the organization will benefit from the transformation. A well-crafted vision is also intended to align team members by providing a common goal. This step includes defining strategies that support the vision and explaining how they will be implemented. This step is meant to build broad support for change. By enlisting a large group of people who are passionate about the change, change professionals seek to generate enthusiasm and drive participation. These volunteers act as ambassadors, sharing the vision and encouraging their peers to support the effort. This involvement fosters a sense of shared responsibility for the success of the initiative. In this step, practitioners must identify and remove obstacles that hinder progress. These barriers can be structural, such as outdated processes, or cultural, such as employee resistance. By eliminating these challenges, leaders look to make an environment where people feel empowered to contribute to the change. This may involve revising workflows, reallocating resources, or providing additional training. Through short-term wins, organizations using Kotter’s model look to build momentum. The aim is to boost morale and build confidence. These wins act as tangible evidence that the change is moving in the right direction. Recognizing and communicating these victories can demonstrate the positive impact of the change and encourage continued efforts. After the initial successes, Kotter includes this step to maintain focus and keep change teams pushing forward. This step involves building on the early wins, scaling the changes across the organization, and addressing any remaining obstacles. It focuses on ongoing improvement, trying to make sure that the change process does not stall or lose momentum before it is fully realized. The final step seeks to ensure the new processes, behaviors, and mindsets are embedded into the organizational or corporate culture. This involves reinforcing the changes by linking them to organizational success and making them a permanent part of the company’s operations. Leaders must continue demonstrating the benefits of the changes, ensuring they become the new standard. Kotter’s 8-step model offers advantages that make it a widely used framework for managing organizational change: The model’s step-by-step process provides a clear, linear roadmap for managing change, simplifying the process for leaders and employees. Each stage builds logically on the previous one, creating a sense of progression. The model emphasizes the importance of strong leadership and guiding coalitions in driving change. This focus ensures that leadership is involved in every phase, fostering commitment at the highest levels of the organization. The model requires a strategic vision to ensure all employees understand the direction of the change effort. This clarity helps align individuals around common goals and keeps everyone focused on the larger purpose. The model encourages identifying and removing barriers early in the process. This allows organizations to tackle issues that could hinder progress before they become significant roadblocks, increasing the likelihood of success. By building on early successes, Kotter’s model helps maintain momentum and engagement throughout the change process. These short-term wins demonstrate that the change is working, boosting morale and encouraging continued effort. Kotter’s model is particularly popular among organizations seeking a structured, leadership-driven approach to change. It emphasizes vision, communication and early success. Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model has its disadvantages, and it certainly isn’t perfect for everyone. Here are some common issues organizations run into: Although the steps are clear, the model does not provide in-depth guidance on successful implementation. This can leave organizations with a high-level roadmap but insufficient practical tools for execution. Because a lack of definition in projects is the number one reason why technology projects fail, this can be particularly problematic. A change model should be a map you and others in your organization can use to navigate through the different stages of change. The model follows a strict, step-by-step approach, which may not be flexible enough for organizations that operate in dynamic or fast-changing environments. The rigid structure can be limiting for businesses that need to adapt quickly or manage multiple overlapping change initiatives. Implementing each step fully requires a significant amount of time and resources. For organizations seeking rapid transformation, the model’s lengthy process may not be suitable, as it could slow down the change effort. The model strongly emphasizes leadership, particularly senior management, to drive change. This top-down focus can result in lower levels of employee engagement and may alienate lower-level staff, who may feel disconnected from the change process. While the model addresses organizational barriers to change, it does not address individual barriers all people face during change. The lack of attention to personal, emotional or psychological barriers leads to significant challenges with change readiness and adoption at the employee level. In fact, Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model overlooks individuals' varying readiness to embrace change. The lack of individuality in the model can result in some people being left behind, especially those who require more support or have specific concerns. Kotter’s model can be too rigid for some environments, time-intensive, and lacking in practical detail, making it less suitable for organizations that need a flexible, people-focused model that aligns with their culture and unique needs. Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model remains relevant today, particularly for organizations looking to implement structured, large-scale change initiatives. However, some adaptations may be necessary as businesses increasingly adopt agile practices and face faster-paced environments. The model’s linear approach can limit dynamic settings, where flexibility and iterative changes are critical. In modern organizations, Kotter’s model is often combined with other frameworks that allow for quicker responses to change. Pairing it with agile methodologies or people-focused approaches like the Prosci ADKAR® Model can offer a more comprehensive strategy, as it balances structured leadership with adaptability. Prosci ADKAR Model Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model and our ADKAR Model both aim to guide organizational change but differ significantly in their focus and systematic approach. Structurally, Kotter’s model is: It’s structured around creating urgency, building coalitions, and embedding change into company culture. In contrast, our ADKAR Model: ADKAR helps employees move through five elements or building blocks: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement. It addresses personal and business-related barriers to change and focuses on individual adoption to ensure organizational success. These differences become apparent when putting a change management strategy into action. Jean-Claude Monney, former Chief Knowledge Officer at Microsoft Services, experienced this firsthand when comparing Kotter’s model with our ADKAR Model. He says, “I started with Kotter, and I think the fundamentals are still valid. But when the rubber hits the road, it's the last part, the last mile. We didn't have a proven method for it. The Prosci ADKAR Model gives that last mile that makes or breaks (when you don’t use it) the whole program.” Both models are valuable, but they address different aspects of change. Combining them can provide a more holistic approach, balancing leadership direction with individual engagement and commitment. While Kotter’s model can drive large-scale strategic initiatives, ADKAR ensures that individuals are supported throughout the process, enhancing overall adoption. Kotter’s 8-Step Model offers a structured, leadership-driven approach for large-scale initiatives. It emphasizes the importance of vision and leadership in driving change. However, as organizations increasingly face the need for agility and adaptability, integrating Kotter’s model with more people-centered frameworks like the Prosci ADKAR Model can provide a more comprehensive strategy. And for organizations looking for a complete organizational change management strategy designed around ADKAR, the Prosci Methodology may be a better choice. By combining Kotter with the ADKAR Model, or adopting the complete Prosci Methodology, organizations can benefit from a balanced approach that leverages both top-down leadership and bottom-up engagement. This ultimately leads to more resilient and effective change management practices. As you evaluate which model best suits your needs, consider how each framework can complement your organizational culture and strategic goals to foster a successful change journey.
